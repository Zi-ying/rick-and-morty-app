# This is a Rick and Morty app created with React, Typescrit and Vite.

You'll be able to go through Rick and Morty characters, episodes and locations's lists, filter over it and display one character, episode or location card.
A paginated list will help you go through the extensive lists.

I used components from shadcn UI, tailwindCSS for styling, Redux for state management and TanStack to fetch data from the API.

First run the command line:
`yarn build`

To start run the command line:
`yarn run dev`

### What's lefy
- Add more testings
- Add different languages
- Uniformize paddings and styles
- Add toaster when removing a favorite card on favorite page
- Redesign navigation
