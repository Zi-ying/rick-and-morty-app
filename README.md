# This is a Rick and Morty app created with React, Typescrit and Vite.

You'll be able to go through Rick and Morty character's list, filter over it and display one character card.
A paginated list will help you go through the extensive list of characters.

I used components from shadcn ui, tailwindCSS for styling, Redux for state management and tanStack to fetch data from the API.

To start run the command line:
`yarn run dev`
